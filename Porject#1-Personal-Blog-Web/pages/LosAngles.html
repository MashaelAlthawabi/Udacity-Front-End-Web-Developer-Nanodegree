        Los Angeles often referred to by its initials L.A is the commercial, financial, and cultural center of Southern
        California.
        Los Angeles is the largest city in California, the second-most populous city in the United States after New York
        City,
        and one of the world's most populous megacities. With a population of roughly 3.9 million residents within the
        city
        limits as of 2020, Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic and cultural diversity, being the
        home of
        the Hollywood film industry, and its sprawling metropolitan area. The majority of the city proper lies in a
        basin in
        Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica
        Mountains 
        and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers
        about 469 square
        miles (1,210 km2), and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United
        States 
        with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022.

        The area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed
        by Juan
        Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe
        de Neve, on
        the village of Yaanga.  It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848,
        at the end of
        the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of
        Guadalupe Hidalgo,
        and thus became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five
        months before
        California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was
        further expanded
        with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.

        Los Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. It has one of the busiest container ports in
        the Americas.
        In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion, making it the
        city with
        the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York City and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the 1932 and 1984 Summer
        Olympics and will host the 2028 Summer Olympics. More recently, statewide droughts in California have strained
        both the city's
        and Los Angeles County's water security.
