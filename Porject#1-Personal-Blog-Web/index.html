    <div class="card-text">
    <p>New York, often called New York City or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States.
      With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is
      the most densely populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los
      Angeles, the nation's second-largest city. The city also has a population that is larger than that
      of 38 individual U.S. states. New York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. The
      city constitutes the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and
      the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and
      urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million
      in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities,
      and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city.

    <div class="card-text">
    <p>Los Angeles is the largest city in California, the second-most populous city in the United States
      after New York City, and one of the world's most populous megacities. With a population of roughly
      3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020, Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean 
      climate, ethnic and cultural diversity, being the home of the Hollywood film industry, and its sprawling
      metropolitan area. The majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the
      Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San 
      Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles
      1,210 km2, and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United
      States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022.
